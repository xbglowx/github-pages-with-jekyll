Hi Cardano Community,

At the end of Dec 2021 I became a Cardano stake pool operator (SPO). Since this is my first time as a SPO there was a lot to learn and configure. Luckily, my day job is in operations, so I had fun standing up everything.

I will go into details in another blog post, but the basics of my setup are:
* Running from my house with a gigabit internet
* Workloads (2 x relays and 1 x producer) run on a two node k3s (kubernetes) cluster

Until next time,
Brian
