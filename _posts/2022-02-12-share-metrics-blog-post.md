Hi all,

Since sharing is caring, I thought I would let everyone see [metrics](https://grafana.glowstake.com/d/fjYpTrbnz/cardano-glow-stake-pool?orgId=2) for my stake pool.

I am still working on tuning garbage collection to help with missed slots. What I have now isn't bad, but I hear zero is ideal. Wish me luck.

Cheers,
Brian
